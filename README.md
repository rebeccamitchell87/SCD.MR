# SCD.MR
Scripts involved with Mendelian Randomization analyses for SCD

README for MR analyses:

Scripts:

SCD.SDtraits.MR.R: MR analysis for SCD and traits that had to be coverted to SD units (QT, QRS, SBP, DBP, HR, FGadjBMI, FIadjBMI)
CAD.SDtraits.MR.R: MR analysis for CAD and traits that had to be converted to SD units (QT, QRS, SBP, DBP, HR, FGadjBMI, FIadjBMI)
SCD.traits.MR.R: MR analysis for other traits and SCD
CAD.traits.MR.R: MR analysis for other traits and CAD
SCD.sbp.dbp.MR.R: MR analysis for SBP and DBP using updated GWS SNPs (performed in Nov 2017)
CreatingSNPoverlapfiles.R: example script for creating file for SNPs that overlap between SCD and trait (trait=AF in this script)
plottingahat.final.R: scripts for plotting ahat (GRSA estimate) used in paper
varianceexplainedplots.R: scripts for creating the trait variance explained plots
